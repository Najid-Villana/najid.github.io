**Secondary Colors:**
- **Warm White (#FAFAFA)**: Clean backgrounds, readability, modern simplicity
- **Charcoal Gray (#4A5568)**: Supporting text, subtle contrasts, technical details
- **Alert Red (#E53E3E)**: Emergency states, critical warnings, fire detection alerts

**Accent Colors:**
- **Success Green (#38A169)**: System ready, operation successful, safety confirmed
- **Warning Amber (#D69E2E)**: Caution states, maintenance alerts, attention required

### Typography
**Primary Font**: Inter (Sans-serif)
- **Headings**: Inter Bold (700) - Clean, technical, highly readable
- **Body Text**: Inter Regular (400) - Professional, accessible, modern
- **Technical Specs**: Inter Medium (500) - Precise, structured, authoritative

**Secondary Font**: JetBrains Mono (Monospace)
- **Code/Data**: Technical specifications, system readouts, diagnostic information
- **Serial Numbers**: Equipment identifiers, model numbers, version codes

## Visual Effects & Styling

### Background Treatment
**Continuous Industrial Gradient**: Subtle dark-to-light gradient from top to bottom, maintaining consistency across all pages. No section-specific backgrounds - differentiation achieved through content positioning and visual elements.

### Header Effects
**Hero Section**: 
- Animated particle system representing AI neural networks
